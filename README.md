<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The goal of our project is to gather data on ozone, PM 2.5, E. coli, lead, and fecal coli levels in the South River Watershed and South Dekalb to create at least three data visualizations and a story surrounding long-term trends in water and air pollution and their health impacts.

Specifically, our research questions are:

1. How do the EPA’s identified unregulated contaminants in drinking water on S. Dekalb’s water sources between 2013 and 2015, 2018 and 2020, and 2021-2023, considering variations in contamination types and their distribution in South Dekalb compare to other counties near Dekalb and what are some possible health outcomes related to high exposure of these contaminants? 

2. How have the levels of key water pollutant parameters (Fluoride, Nitrate, Chlorine, Trihalomethanes, Haloacetic Acids, Copper, Lead, Turbidity, Total Organic Carbon, and Total Coliform) in Dekalb County changed over recent years (2018-2022)?

3. How have levels of key air pollutants, such as PM2.5 and Ozone changed over the past 5 years?

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

For each research question, to create a cohesive data story, we will:
- [ ] Identify and analyze the relevant dataset
    - [ ] Create a subset of data to contain only Georgia or Dekalb
- [ ] Create a data visualization (interactive or otherwise)
    - [ ] Contaminant Type Selection
    - [ ] Time series or county comparison
- [ ] Relay health impacts
    - [ ] Include a summary of the health impacts of high exposure to the contaminant type
    - [ ] Outline actions community members can take
